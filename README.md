2. Change directory to `cash-advance-dashboard` folder
3. Run `npm install`
4. Run `npm start`

# Design decisions
- I kept the design relatively simple, with a dark mode toggle as well. I didn't play around too much with colors, but I felt that the repayments should be treated as debits and the cash advances should be treated as credits since this is keeping track of your cash advance balance.
- I felt that the transactions were effectively like a ledger, so I decided to structure it as a table instead of a list with a date and a positive or negative amount depending on the type of transaction along with a status.
- I tried to position the balance and the request a cash advance button on the top and big to make sure it was a clear call to action
- I didn't spend too much time playing with fonts or colors because this is a more operational tool. I just wanted something clean and crisp.
